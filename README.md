# C-Sharp-OOP-Demo-From-Pluralsight
Following along with Pluralsight's lectures, this code covers many aspects of CSharp development including TDD, overloading constructors, objects, methods, inheritance, interfaces, etc.  This was a great review.

The Pluralsight course name was "Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals in C#."
